        Windows is an operating system designed by Microsoft. The operating system is what allows you to use a computer.
        Windows comes preloaded on most new personal computers (PCs), which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.<br>
        Windows makes it possible to complete all types of everyday tasks on your computer. For example, you can use Windows to browse the Internet,
        check your email, edit digital photos, listen to music, play games, and do much more.<br>
        Windows is also used in many offices because it gives you access to productivity tools such as calendars, word processors, and spreadsheets.<br>
        Microsoft released the first version of Windows in the mid-1980s. There have been many versions of Windows since then,
        but the most recent ones include Windows 10 (released in 2015), Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009), Windows Vista (2007), and Windows XP (2001).
